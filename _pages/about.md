My name is Ameya Deshpande. I am a student pursuing Computer Science and Engineering at National Institute of Technology Karnataka,     Surathkal [(NITK)](https://www.nitk.ac.in/). I am always excited to learn and try out new things. Along the course of my studies, I have particularly developed    interests towards to Algorithms and Networking. I plan on discovering a lot more Computer Science fields.

I am an Executive Member at [IEEE NITK](https://ieee.nitk.ac.in/) and [Web Enthusiasts'](https://webclub.nitk.ac.in/) Club at NITK. Along the way, I have worked on some of the most interesting   projects in Distributed Computing, Android, Web and IoT.
